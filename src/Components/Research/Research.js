          Aug 2020 - Jan 2021 Summary Heading : Designed and developed a model
          to spot diseases in plants, vegetables and fruits using Deep Learning
          and Machine Learning. Formulated special algorithms which compares
          existing diseases captured in mobile with the available data images
          found in the public data set. The background with a special algorithm
          can identify possible diseases with a public data set . This
          particular model can aid with utmost accuracy upto 99% as the
          validation is done with more than 60K images. â€‹Research : My
          involvement included research to collect data from farmers,
          agriculture institution to learn, understand the issue , analyze ,
          document and identify workable solution among alternates I have
          collaborated with my mentor , Sandeeep Kumar Ramani, a graduate AI/ML
          student from University of Wisconsin, Madison to develop a working
          prototype .
